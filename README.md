### Editing the Documentation

Ultimate Hasura Starter uses [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) to build its documentation. All of the docs are written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and can be found in the `/docs` folder of this project. For additional reference, see Docsify's docs [here](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=what-it-is).

To serve the docs with hot-reloading, please run:

```
npx docsify serve docs
```
